# phidgets-indigo

An update to the [Phidgets Plugin](https://www.indigodomo.com/pluginstore/76/)
for [Indigo](https://www.indigodomo.com/).

## Requirements

- [Phidgets 2.2 Driver](https://www.phidgets.com/docs/OS_-_macOS)

## Other notes

- The [Phidgets Python 2.2 API](https://www.phidgets.com/docs/Language_-_Python) has been included, with a minor modification to use utf-8 encoding. This was required for python2.7 to grok Â± which is used in several of the comments.
